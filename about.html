      * I was recently called a "Hybrid" during a UX designers debate and that
      is the core of who i am as a person. I am both a designer and developer
      and therefore I understand how the two worlds influence each other which
      is very creative but also very effective. As a developer I think about the
      edge cases and as a designer I can design every detail early on.

        I strive for the unity of design and technology. Being highly visual, I
        approach web development from a design first point of view and frontend
        development is where I thrive. I love to invest time in building modern
        UI that fits every viewport. I have a background in technology, robotics
        and electronics, music and art. As an tech nerd with a playful artistic
        mindset, I love to challenge traditional paths and develop new ways of
        visual communication. I play my piano daily: it's like a meditation for
        me. I also occasionally work on music and sound design for film, 3D
        interactive installations and theatre. <br /><br />Trivia: I write with
        my left hand but in the opposite direction, mimicking a right hand
        handwriting.
